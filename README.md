# My 10 day Kokoda Trail Diary (un-edited)

Way back in ???? I took a lone trip to walk the Kokoda Trail.

On this walk, I made what I though were some diary entries as well as having taken some 4000+ digital photos.
So, might as well put this up on the Internet like everything else in life these days.

The diary entries are transcribed work for word from my paper diary and in no way flowered to make for better reading.
