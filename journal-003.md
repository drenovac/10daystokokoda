# Goldie River

13.10 water is freezing, creek shoes off
S09.21.644, E147.29.885 +- 37

Porters are barefooted and / or $20 Adidas, whilst we've all got the  latest from Katmandu, fucking wankers
It's filthy hot like being in a sauna
2nd time already that i've lost my hat

15.30 fucking hill 09.21.159, E147.31.561 +-49

Hill, hill, fucking hill, top of river. Tomorrow we can rest to 05.30 as we're ahead. 
Golden staircase and it still looks like more climbing
jungle vines, muddy moss on rocks, filthy fucking hard
my feet are pulsating, boots are filthy

15.50 last of troupe is now here
I tired and wonder what will this prove for me

near.30 or so, we're near camp. Can't get GPS for the tall trees

Helpers are lopping and clearing near stream, making community sleeper.
One little yellow tent is pitched, i take what i think is a good position only to be downward of the cooking
1 cook for 50 - 60 people, can't see this working
He boils a huge pot of water for tea, and there's all these floaty bits in it

Shower is downstream and well i drop my dacks, water is welcome but it's a mountain stream

We are two other blokes are down river of lady on trip, butts on parade, but if she was younger we'd be lining up to see her downstream.
Then into water for tomorrow, guzzled 4l for 1/2 day, hope we get to top up tomorrow.

God help me, where's the loo?

18.00 no food yet, light is poor
Someone out there is rumble of thunder, means all kit into tent 

Looks fucking smaller even though they call it a two man tent

This is for fools only

Fucking ants are 2cm long, stuff and mozzies. My lower back is just so tight in getting up
Tomorrow is 05.30 to rise

what do you put on feet? I'm sure I've got some, but which is it?
dark now, wearing my $10 1.5 glasses
This is Friday done
S,S,M,T,W,T,F,S 8 days to go
My kids, hope you're all fine
Tent is being crawled over by bugs and spiders
Looks like no need for long jeans tonight as we're not high enough.
18.07 I'm moving into tent.
