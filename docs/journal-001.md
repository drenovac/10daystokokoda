Brisbane airport long walk to gate 74. Perfect new loo, and a wonderous sight at gate 80, a 747 plane load of New Zealanders leaving for home, sight to die for.


scheduled arrival was 11.45, door closed 1250.

I can ????? like old uncles house. Seat rests have ash trays but no lids, one previous owner.

I have 3 seats to myself
Window seat, we're leaving 13.00, says 3 hours fly time
Am blind, i need glasses to read
The economy section is 2/3 full
Going to be alone for 11 days, what will I get out of this?
14.00 over white clouds, so much value for having window seat. Steward looks just like photos of fuzzy wuzzy, still more friendly than any United Airlines hostie.
The oboard film was something '60s.
15.10 neck is killing me, and there's nothign to rest against, clouds are white.

The idea of being away from the world is foreign to me, I've never experienced this. How can a loner like me survive? "You'll enjoy it", "Adventure of a lifetime" is what Karin kept on saying, like you'd know.

Lunch - should have had it.

Landing pass - where are you staying, left it blank, I've no idea.

15.40 landed
17.00 at hotel. Room 106 Don & Gary got ?, so i have a room to myself.
I see 6 kids in back of ute, people walking slowly
Markets on side of road selling limes
Houses on stilts
Hotel on beach, guard with metal detector behind large steel gates
it's hot

17.15 meeting re next week's progress
Couple young guys here with their father retracking where their pop had fought.

Other all look older than I
? young blokes look like they'll do it in their stride
19.00 dinner, again every one chatting
am trying to pack all this stuff into packs, all takes a lot of space
Have pinch in lower back, something's annoying me
it's 22.00 am tired.
Fucking next door must be having a disco, it's so loud. How will these days pass??
Business end starts soon
