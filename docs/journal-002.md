08.40 Bamena Cemetery (09.23.783 E147.15.105) this wa snever going to mean anythng to me as I'm not a real Aussie by birth, but walking by these graves and reading 19, 20 & 22 year olds tears well in my eyes as I think of my Danie, couldn't bear to lose him.
Sweat is pouring off my brow from this stroll, feet are fucking hot
How the hell will I ever last 9 days of walking
Some people have found significant graves

I guess if I feel this for strangers how reatful would they be to see their fathe, grandad or uncle. It's going to be a murderous 9 days
am grateful for the overcast skies, the mosquito repelant is keeping everythign away but my eyes and skin are burning. The truck load of porters is laying atop the truck cabin and last waiting.

AM tols 2.5 support for every one of us 23.

Guard at hotel gets paid 2 kina / hour and works 12 hour days, 5 - 7 days, 4 days off, compared to us at $100 / hour or more.

The poverty along the roads, yesterdays lime that i thought is beetle but, toxic when mixed with some other shit, gives cancer of mouth, and why they all have red lips.

Guy just telling porters not to chew "????" inside grounds
IF I paid $570 x 21 = ??
= x of guard for 9 days work

87% unemployment in Port Moresby, what hope there?
