Saturday, 05.30 "cooee", fucking wanker
My $10 glasses are broken, so one hand to hold them whilst writing with the other
Well, no rain last night, so my fucking stinking shoes spent night inside for naught.
Went to sleep 18.40, work 4 - 5 times and thankfully back to sleep
Was quick out of tent, 1st to dunny, my fucking scariest challenge.

Porters had prepared 4-5' deep hole atop hill, so all you had to do was squat and do your business
Thank God the food bound it all, precision clean, other than leaking everywhere. The big challenge was complete

Breakfast was an assortment of warmed canned spaghetti and noodles, cereal and milk which tasted really milky
coffee

stuff around your groin, fucking stinking clothes from yesterday, I reak of self and it's fucking disgusting

06.40, the porters are across the creek eating, smoking. They're alraedy pulled all the tents down, my porter has taken my bag
Our briefing is at 07.00
Supposed easy day to finish by 16.00
Lots of red shirts, they look like a team
Head porter Robin is quiet spoken short fellow, cookie who's not been the cook often I hear as he speaks to our team lead and medic - who's in yellow.
They're all quite unassuming people and none of us are rude or superior, we're all apprecitive

The other guys are all Steve Erwin garb, it's ? they work clothes or they've gone to the same shop. I;mt the weird one never having been outside a lounge room

Left 07.10up, down

08.30 S09.20.436, E147.31.469 +-75'
Imitia Ridge

Walking through 8 pissy little creeks challenge to lift feet, not catch on ground creepers, then you're up hill slide like clay. Shoes have 1cm clay so you just slide, fuck

The littles branch is respite to hold as you feet move beneath you, there branches which have small thorns, very painful.

Weapons pit, stand and shoot
not to put ammo

180 shell scrape andyou soon learn not to grab. 
We've stopped, met another tour of 8 people going shorter course

08.45 and I am absolutely wet, backis drenchaed, want to drink but have no idea where's next drink so have to be careful.
One of the young guys told the leader he has slight chest pain, told to take shoes off
It's very lovely here, insect sounds and chirp of the birds

At each stop, leader reads his notes of what happened here, the guys are all attentive
they've all studied this 
I'm ignorant to fully appreciative the battle
